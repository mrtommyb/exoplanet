A quick intro to PyMC3 for exoplaneteers
========================================

`Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
(HMC) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_Monte_Carlo>`__ methods
haven’t been widely used in astrophysics, but they are the standard
methods for probabilistic inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) in many other fields. *exoplanet* is designed to provide the
building blocks for fitting many exoplanet datasets using this
technology, and this tutorial presents some of the basic features of the
`PyMC3 <https://docs.pymc.io/>`__ modeling language and inference
engine. The `documentation for PyMC3 <https://docs.pymc.io/>`__ includes
many other tutorials that you should check out to get more familiar with
the features that are available.

In this tutorial, we will go through two simple examples of fitting some
data using PyMC3. The first is the classic fitting a line to data with
unknown error bars, and the second is a more relevant example where we
fit a radial velocity model to the public radial velocity observations
of `51 Peg <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/51_Pegasi>`__. You can read
more about fitting lines to data `in the bible of line
fitting <https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.4686>`__ and you can see another
example of fitting the 51 Peg data using HMC (this time using
`Stan <http://mc-stan.org>`__)
`here <https://dfm.io/posts/stan-c++/>`__.

Hello world (AKA fitting a line to data)
----------------------------------------

My standard intro to a new modeling language or inference framework is
to fit a line to data. So. Let’s do that with PyMC3.

To start, we’ll generate some fake data using a linear model. Feel free
to change the random number seed to try out a different dataset.

.. code:: python

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    np.random.seed(42)
    
    true_m = 0.5
    true_b = -1.3
    true_logs = np.log(0.3)
    
    x = np.sort(np.random.uniform(0, 5, 50))
    y = true_b + true_m * x + np.exp(true_logs) * np.random.randn(len(x))
    
    plt.plot(x, y, ".k")
    plt.ylim(-2, 2)
    plt.xlabel("x")
    plt.ylabel("y")




.. parsed-literal::

    Text(0, 0.5, 'y')




.. image:: intro-to-pymc3_files/intro-to-pymc3_4_1.png


To fit a model to these data, our model will have 3 parameters: the
slope :math:`m`, the intercept :math:`b`, and the log of the uncertainty
:math:`\log(\sigma)`. To start, let’s choose broad uniform priors on
these parameters:

.. math::


   \begin{eqnarray}
   p(m) &=& \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
   1/10 & \mathrm{if}\,-5 < m < 5 \\
   0 & \mathrm{otherwise} \\
   \end{array}\right. \\
   p(b) &=& \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
   1/10 & \mathrm{if}\,-5 < b < 5 \\
   0 & \mathrm{otherwise} \\
   \end{array}\right. \\
   p(\log(\sigma)) &=& \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
   1/10 & \mathrm{if}\,-5 < b < 5 \\
   0 & \mathrm{otherwise} \\
   \end{array}\right.
   \end{eqnarray}

Then, the log-likelihood function will be

.. math::


   \log p(\{y_n\}\,|\,m,\,b,\,\log(\sigma)) = -\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n=1}^N \left[\frac{(y_n - m\,x_n - b)^2}{\sigma^2} + \log(2\,\pi\,\sigma^2)\right]

[**Note:** the second normalization term is needed in this model because
we are fitting for :math:`\sigma` and the second term is *not* a
constant.]

Another way of writing this model that might not be familiar is the
following:

.. math::


   \begin{eqnarray}
   m &\sim& \mathrm{Uniform}(-5,\,5) \\
   b &\sim& \mathrm{Uniform}(-5,\,5) \\
   \log(\sigma) &\sim& \mathrm{Uniform}(-5,\,5) \\
   y_n &\sim& \mathrm{Normal}(m\,x_n+b,\,\sigma)
   \end{eqnarray}

This is the way that a model like this is often defined in statistics
and it will be useful when we implement out model in PyMC3 so take a
moment to make sure that you understand the notation.

Now, let’s implement this model in PyMC3. The documentation for the
distributions available in PyMC3’s modeling language can be `found
here <https://docs.pymc.io/api/distributions/continuous.html>`__ and
these will come in handy as you go on to write your own models.

.. code:: python

    import pymc3 as pm
    
    with pm.Model() as model:
    
        # Define the priors on each parameter:
        m = pm.Uniform("m", lower=-5, upper=5)
        b = pm.Uniform("b", lower=-5, upper=5)
        logs = pm.Uniform("logs", lower=-5, upper=5)
    
        # Define the likelihood. A few comments:
        #  1. For mathematical operations like "exp", you can't use
        #     numpy. Instead, use the mathematical operations defined
        #     in "pm.math".
        #  2. To condition on data, you use the "observed" keyword
        #     argument to any distribution. In this case, we want to
        #     use the "Normal" distribution (look up the docs for
        #     this).
        pm.Normal("obs", mu=m * x + b, sd=pm.math.exp(logs), observed=y)
    
        # This is how you will sample the model. Take a look at the
        # docs to see that other parameters that are available.
        trace = pm.sample(draws=1000, tune=1000, chains=2, cores=2)


.. parsed-literal::

    Sampling 2 chains, 0 divergences: 100%|██████████| 4000/4000 [00:03<00:00, 1269.26draws/s]


Now since we now have samples, let’s make some diagnostic plots. The
first plot to look at is the “traceplot” implemented in PyMC3. In this
plot, you’ll see the marginalized distribution for each parameter on the
left and the trace plot (parameter value as a function of step number)
on the right. In each panel, you should see two lines with different
colors. These are the results of different independent chains and if the
results are substantially different in the different chains then there
is probably something going wrong.

.. code:: python

    _ = pm.traceplot(trace, var_names=["m", "b", "logs"])



.. image:: intro-to-pymc3_files/intro-to-pymc3_8_0.png


It’s also good to quantify that “looking substantially different”
argument. This is implemented in PyMC3 as the “summary” function. In
this table, some of the key columns to look at are ``n_eff`` and
``Rhat``. \* ``n_eff`` shows an estimate of the number of effective (or
independent) samples for that parameter. In this case, ``n_eff`` should
probably be around 500 per chain (there should have been 2 chains run).
\* ``Rhat`` shows the `Gelman–Rubin
statistic <https://docs.pymc.io/api/diagnostics.html#pymc3.diagnostics.gelman_rubin>`__
and it should be close to 1.

.. code:: python

    pm.summary(trace, var_names=["m", "b", "logs"])

The last diagnostic plot that we’ll make here is the `corner plot made
using corner.py <https://corner.readthedocs.io>`__. The easiest way to
do this using PyMC3 is to first convert the trace to a `Pandas
DataFrame <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`__ and then pass that to
``corner.py``.

.. code:: python

    import corner  # https://corner.readthedocs.io
    
    samples = pm.trace_to_dataframe(trace, varnames=["m", "b", "logs"])
    _ = corner.corner(samples, truths=[true_m, true_b, true_logs])

**Extra credit:** Here are a few suggestions for things to try out while
getting more familiar with PyMC3:

1. Try initializing the parameters using the ``testval`` argument to the
   distributions. Does this improve performance in this case? It will
   substantially improve performance in more complicated examples.
2. Try changing the priors on the parameters. For example, try the
   “uninformative” prior `recommended by Jake VanderPlas on his
   blog <http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/06/14/frequentism-and-bayesianism-4-bayesian-in-python/#Prior-on-Slope-and-Intercept>`__.
3. What happens as you substantially increase or decrease the simulated
   noise? Does the performance change significantly? Why?

A more realistic example: radial velocity exoplanets
----------------------------------------------------

While the above example was cute, it doesn’t really fully exploit the
power of PyMC3 and it doesn’t really show some of the real issues that
you will face when you use PyMC3 as an astronomer. To get a better sense
of how you might use PyMC3 in Real Life™, let’s take a look at a more
realistic example: fitting a Keplerian orbit to radial velocity
observations.

One of the key aspects of this problem that I want to highlight is the
fact that PyMC3 (and the underlying model building framework
`Theano <http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/>`__) don’t have
out-of-the-box support for the root-finding that is required to solve
Kepler’s equation. As part of the process of computing a Keplerian RV
model, we must solve the equation:

.. math::


   M = E - e\,\sin E

for the eccentric anomaly :math:`E` given some mean anomaly :math:`M`
and eccentricity :math:`e`. There are commonly accepted methods of
solving this equation using `Newton’s
method <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method>`__, but if we
want to expose that to PyMC3, we have to define a `custom Theano
operation <http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/extending/extending_theano.html>`__
with a custom gradient. I won’t go into the details of the math (because
`I blogged about it <https://dfm.io/posts/stan-c++/>`__) and I won’t go
into the details of the implementation (because `you can take a look at
it on
GitHub <https://github.com/exoplanet-dev/exoplanet/tree/master/exoplanet/theano_ops/kepler>`__).
So, for this tutorial, we’ll use the custom Kepler solver that is
implemented as part of *exoplanet* and fit the publicly available radial
velocity observations of the famous exoplanetary system 51 Peg using
PyMC3.

First, we need to download the data from the exoplanet archive:

.. code:: python

    import requests
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    # Download the dataset from the Exoplanet Archive:
    url = "https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/data/ExoData/0113/0113357/data/UID_0113357_RVC_001.tbl"
    r = requests.get(url)
    if r.status_code != requests.codes.ok:
        r.raise_for_status()
    data = np.array(
        [
            l.split()
            for l in r.text.splitlines()
            if not l.startswith("\\") and not l.startswith("|")
        ],
        dtype=float,
    )
    t, rv, rv_err = data.T
    t -= np.mean(t)
    
    # Plot the observations "folded" on the published period:
    # Butler et al. (2006) https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0607493
    lit_period = 4.230785
    plt.errorbar(
        (t % lit_period) / lit_period, rv, yerr=rv_err, fmt=".k", capsize=0
    )
    plt.xlim(0, 1)
    plt.ylim(-110, 110)
    plt.annotate(
        "period = {0:.6f} days".format(lit_period),
        xy=(1, 0),
        xycoords="axes fraction",
        xytext=(-5, 5),
        textcoords="offset points",
        ha="right",
        va="bottom",
        fontsize=12,
    )
    plt.ylabel("radial velocity [m/s]")
    _ = plt.xlabel("phase")



.. image:: intro-to-pymc3_files/intro-to-pymc3_14_0.png


Now, here’s the implementation of a radial velocity model in PyMC3. Some
of this will look familiar after the Hello World example, but things are
a bit more complicated now. Take a minute to take a look through this
and see if you can follow it. There’s a lot going on, so I want to point
out a few things to pay attention to:

1. All of the mathematical operations (for example ``exp`` and ``sqrt``)
   are being performed using Theano instead of NumPy.
2. All of the parameters have initial guesses provided. This is an
   example where this makes a big difference because some of the
   parameters (like period) are very tightly constrained.
3. Some of the lines are wrapped in ``Deterministic`` distributions.
   This can be useful because it allows us to track values as the chain
   progresses even if they’re not parameters. For example, after
   sampling, we will have a sample for ``bkg`` (the background RV trend)
   for each step in the chain. This can be especially useful for making
   plots of the results.
4. Similarly, at the end of the model definition, we compute the RV
   curve for a single orbit on a fine grid. This can be very useful for
   diagnosing fits gone wrong.
5. For parameters that specify angles (like :math:`\omega`, called ``w``
   in the model below), it can be inefficient to sample in the angle
   directly because of the fact that the value wraps around at
   :math:`2\pi`. Instead, it can be better to sample the unit vector
   specified by the angle. In practice, this can be achieved by sampling
   a 2-vector from an isotropic Gaussian and normalizing the components
   by the norm. This is implemented as part of *exoplanet* in the
   :class:`exoplanet.distributions.Angle` class.

.. code:: python

    import theano.tensor as tt
    
    from exoplanet.orbits import get_true_anomaly
    from exoplanet.distributions import Angle
    
    with pm.Model() as model:
    
        # Parameters
        logK = pm.Uniform(
            "logK",
            lower=0,
            upper=np.log(200),
            testval=np.log(0.5 * (np.max(rv) - np.min(rv))),
        )
        logP = pm.Uniform(
            "logP", lower=0, upper=np.log(10), testval=np.log(lit_period)
        )
        phi = pm.Uniform("phi", lower=0, upper=2 * np.pi, testval=0.1)
        e = pm.Uniform("e", lower=0, upper=1, testval=0.1)
        w = Angle("w")
        logjitter = pm.Uniform(
            "logjitter", lower=-10, upper=5, testval=np.log(np.mean(rv_err))
        )
        rv0 = pm.Normal("rv0", mu=0.0, sd=10.0, testval=0.0)
        rvtrend = pm.Normal("rvtrend", mu=0.0, sd=10.0, testval=0.0)
    
        # Deterministic transformations
        n = 2 * np.pi * tt.exp(-logP)
        P = pm.Deterministic("P", tt.exp(logP))
        K = pm.Deterministic("K", tt.exp(logK))
        cosw = tt.cos(w)
        sinw = tt.sin(w)
        s2 = tt.exp(2 * logjitter)
        t0 = (phi + w) / n
    
        # The RV model
        bkg = pm.Deterministic("bkg", rv0 + rvtrend * t / 365.25)
        M = n * t - (phi + w)
    
        # This is the line that uses the custom Kepler solver
        f = get_true_anomaly(M, e + tt.zeros_like(M))
        rvmodel = pm.Deterministic(
            "rvmodel", bkg + K * (cosw * (tt.cos(f) + e) - sinw * tt.sin(f))
        )
    
        # Condition on the observations
        err = tt.sqrt(rv_err ** 2 + tt.exp(2 * logjitter))
        pm.Normal("obs", mu=rvmodel, sd=err, observed=rv)
    
        # Compute the phased RV signal
        phase = np.linspace(0, 1, 500)
        M_pred = 2 * np.pi * phase - (phi + w)
        f_pred = get_true_anomaly(M_pred, e + tt.zeros_like(M_pred))
        rvphase = pm.Deterministic(
            "rvphase", K * (cosw * (tt.cos(f_pred) + e) - sinw * tt.sin(f_pred))
        )

In this case, I’ve found that it is useful to first optimize the
parameters to find the “maximum a posteriori” (MAP) parameters and then
start the sampler from there. This is useful here because MCMC is not
designed to *find* the maximum of the posterior; it’s just meant to
sample the shape of the posterior. The performance of all MCMC methods
can be really bad when the initialization isn’t good (especially when
some parameters are very well constrained). To find the maximum a
posteriori parameters using PyMC3, you can use the
:func:`exoplanet.optimize` function:

.. code:: python

    from exoplanet import optimize
    
    with model:
        map_params = optimize()


.. parsed-literal::

    optimizing logp for variables: [rvtrend, rv0, logjitter, w, e, phi, logP, logK]

    message: Desired error not necessarily achieved due to precision loss.
    logp: -1325.8433398976674 -> -835.1912653583977


Let’s make a plot to check that this initialization looks reasonable. In
the top plot, we’re looking at the RV observations as a function of time
with the initial guess for the long-term trend overplotted in blue. In
the lower panel, we plot the “folded” curve where we have wrapped the
observations onto the best-fit period and the prediction for a single
overplotted in orange. If this doesn’t look good, try adjusting the
initial guesses for the parameters and see if you can get a better fit.

**Exercise:** Try changing the initial guesses for the parameters (as
specified by the ``testval`` argument) and see how sensitive the results
are to these values. Are there some parameters that are less important?
Why is this?

.. code:: python

    fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(8, 8))
    
    period = map_params["P"]
    
    ax = axes[0]
    ax.errorbar(t, rv, yerr=rv_err, fmt=".k")
    ax.plot(t, map_params["bkg"], color="C0", lw=1)
    ax.set_ylim(-110, 110)
    ax.set_ylabel("radial velocity [m/s]")
    ax.set_xlabel("time [days]")
    
    ax = axes[1]
    ax.errorbar(t % period, rv - map_params["bkg"], yerr=rv_err, fmt=".k")
    ax.plot(phase * period, map_params["rvphase"], color="C1", lw=1)
    ax.set_ylim(-110, 110)
    ax.set_ylabel("radial velocity [m/s]")
    ax.set_xlabel("phase [days]")
    
    plt.tight_layout()



.. image:: intro-to-pymc3_files/intro-to-pymc3_20_0.png


Now let’s sample the posterior starting from our MAP estimate.

.. code:: python

    with model:
        trace = pm.sample(
            draws=2000, tune=1000, start=map_params, chains=2, cores=2
        )


.. parsed-literal::

    There were 19 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
    There were 15 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.


As above, it’s always a good idea to take a look at the summary
statistics for the chain. If everything went as planned, there should be
more than 1000 effective samples per chain and the Rhat values should be
close to 1. (Not too bad for less than 30 seconds of run time!)

.. code:: python

Similarly, we can make the corner plot again for this model.

.. code:: python

    samples = pm.trace_to_dataframe(trace, varnames=["K", "P", "e", "w"])
    _ = corner.corner(samples)

Finally, the last plot that we’ll make here is of the posterior
predictive density. In this case, this means that we want to look at the
distribution of predicted models that are consistent with the data. As
above, the top plot shows the raw observations as black error bars and
the RV trend model is overplotted in blue. But, this time, the blue line
is actually composed of 25 lines that are samples from the posterior
over trends that are consistent with the data. In the bottom panel, the
orange lines indicate the same 25 posterior samples for the RV curve of
one orbit.

.. code:: python

    fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(8, 8))
    
    period = map_params["P"]
    
    ax = axes[0]
    ax.errorbar(t, rv, yerr=rv_err, fmt=".k")
    ax.set_ylabel("radial velocity [m/s]")
    ax.set_xlabel("time [days]")
    
    ax = axes[1]
    ax.errorbar(t % period, rv - map_params["bkg"], yerr=rv_err, fmt=".k")
    ax.set_ylabel("radial velocity [m/s]")
    ax.set_xlabel("phase [days]")
    
    for i in np.random.randint(len(trace) * trace.nchains, size=25):
        axes[0].plot(t, trace["bkg"][i], color="C0", lw=1, alpha=0.3)
        axes[1].plot(
            phase * period, trace["rvphase"][i], color="C1", lw=1, alpha=0.3
        )
    
    axes[0].set_ylim(-110, 110)
    axes[1].set_ylim(-110, 110)
    
    plt.tight_layout()
